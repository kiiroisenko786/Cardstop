# Cardstop
This is a reuploaded repository which included the restructuring of the Cardstop
and temporary razor pages introduction project.

This web project is designed to be similar to other TGC retailers, including
payment integration. 

This project is intended to be completed using .NET 8 (Latest Preview),
MVC, SQL, SQL Server Management Studio 19 and potentially Stripe integration and
Azure/AWS.

Brave browser (shields) and some ad-blocking plugins are known to cause
issues and can result in the Cardstop web project crashing.
