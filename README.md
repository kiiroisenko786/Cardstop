# Cardstop
This is a reuploaded repository which included the restructuring of the Cardstop
and temporary razor pages introduction project.

This web project is designed to be similar to other TGC retailers, including
payment integration. 

This project is intended to be completed using .NET 8 (Latest Preview),
MVC, SQL, SQL Server Management Studio 19 and potentially Stripe integration and
Azure/AWS.

Brave browser (shields) and some ad-blocking plugins are known to cause
issues and can result in the Cardstop web project crashing.

Other issues encountered:
Visual Studio 2022 Preview
-> When attempting to commit and push, error "Pipe has been ended" or "Pipe has been broken" occurs
-> Remains unresolved, fix not found
-> Workaround by using Git Bash terminal instead
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 19.3
-> When attempting to access local SQL server ".", the client fails to connect for an unknown reason
-> Reinstalling has previously helped but sometimes does not work.
