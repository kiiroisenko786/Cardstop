# Cardstop

Cardstop is currently an in-progress side project, designed to function similar to other online TCG retailers.

This project plans to incorporate C#, .NET using the latest preview of .NET 8, SQL Management Studio
and eventually some form of payment processor to make it a functional e-commerce style project.
